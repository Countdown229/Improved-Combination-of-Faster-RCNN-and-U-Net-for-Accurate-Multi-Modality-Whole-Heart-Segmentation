# Improved-Combination-of-Faster-RCNN-and-U-Net-for-Accurate-Multi-Modality-Whole-Heart-Segmentation

The sufficient code will be released after the paper is received.

We adopt the MM-WHS 2017 Challenge's dataset.

The official dataset is here: http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zhuangxiahai/0/mmwhs/


If you make use of the code, please cite the paper in any resulting publications.
